# TOY MODELS
Toy Models is a Processing library being developed as a twofold project. In one hand, the library works as an experimental aparatus serving a practice-based research into the technical and theoretical implications of dialoques taking place within the triple of voice, language and automatons. Secondly, the project intends to establish, through documentation and design options, a high-level intelligible layer that allows for this collection of computational tools to operate as an introductory channel for undergrad students having their first contact to the subject at hands.
